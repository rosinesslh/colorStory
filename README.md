# colorStory

Type anything and see what colors suit the description
ColorStory will render the returned colors and you can click on the color block to copy the color's hex code

\Note: it might take several minutes when first loading the project cause glitch needs to start the backend server.

## Tech Stack
Backend: Flask<br>
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
Utilizing OpenAI Completions API to generate the recommended colors

## Motivation
I followed several ig accounts that recommend trending color palettes for my journals. I thought it would be cool to just have my own app doing that so that I can choose the topics for the color palettes whenever I need<br>
That's the start of ColorStory<br>
It uses OpenAI Completions API for color recommendation so the input can be more flexible<br>
I chose Flask because it is lightweight<br>
And it's hosted on Glitch for easy access<br>
